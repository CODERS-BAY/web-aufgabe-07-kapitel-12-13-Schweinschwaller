                    An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text
                    is a fraud. Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your
                    website. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small,
                    something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Lorem Ispum is a
                    choke artist. It chokes! All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or
                    unconsciously. That's to be expected.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! He’s
                    not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. You
                    know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of
                    text.

                            I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than
                            me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text
                            on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.
                            We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.

                            Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small,
                            something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. I have a 10
                            year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. I think my
                            strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. Lorem
                            Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is
                            that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful.
